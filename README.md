This is a web application I am in the process of developing to help people track some basic metrics in their life in an attempt to help them determine their personal formula for how to have a "good" day.

This project is under development. It is written in HTML, CSS, and PHP with a MySQL database in the background.

The idea of the app is to have users track 5-6 basic life metrics every day. After data has been collected, users can see their daily satisfaction levels through use of visual graphs in order to help determine their personal formula for having a "good" day.
